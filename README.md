# Interactive Form

In this project, JavaScript was used to enhance the interactive of a registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference. Using supplied HTML and CSS, I added my own JavaScript code to make the form more user-friendly by:

- Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
